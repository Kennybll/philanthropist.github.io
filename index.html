  <h1>PhilanthropistCoin</h1>
  <h3>SAVE THE WORLD</h3>

  <pre>
      Anyone and everyone who loves cryptocurrency can help the world.

      I am starting a new cryptocurrency called PhilanthropistCoin. It is a javascript coin, wallet, and block explorer. It was forked from naive-coin.
      
      Every time someone mines a block they get 50 PhilanthropistCoin. But an extra 50 PhilanthropistCoin goes to a "charity" address where nonprofits/charities can request funds from.
      
      Currently the code supports transactions. Soon I will make a way for users to vote where the "charity" funds go.
      
      The current algorithm is POW (Proof of Work). This will stay the same, but I will also add in DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake). That addition will allow for the voting.
      
      The idea came from a mix of bitshares and wanting to help the world. Bitshares created a funding system to fund their workers all by the users voting for them. The funds came in the beginning. Then users can vote to where the funds can go. I want that but where users can vote what charities/nonprofits to help.
